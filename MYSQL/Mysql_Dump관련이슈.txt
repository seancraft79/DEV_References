I spent the whole day looking for a solution, and singed up here just to share mine.

Yes, probably this error is due to versions difference.

Just download the MySQL 5.7 ZIP Archive from here: 

https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ 
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html#downloads

and unzip it, then use the mysqldump.exe file from there.

If you are using MySQL Workbench, you will need to set a path to the mysqldump Tool you downloaded by going to Edit -> Preferences -> Administration (from left hand pane).

Hope this helps.
